      "explanation": "The email effectively communicates the intent to request thesis information, scoring high on intent accuracy. The tone is somewhat formal but could be improved by using a more formal greeting and closing, hence the tone alignment and professionalism scores. Clarity is good, as the request is straightforward. Completeness is slightly lacking as it doesn't specify what information is needed or provide context about the thesis. Grammar is nearly perfect, contributing to a high overall score."
